# Large Scale Image Similarity Search

Technologies: OpenCv, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Faiss, Flask

Search by image and return closely matched images. Can search 15,000 Amazon book images in 1-2 sec.

The images and data are proprietary and are not included in this repository

# Key Learning Objectives

Computer Vision techniques with OpenCV (SIFT, RANSAC, Filtering, VLAD)

Machine Learning techniques with Scikit-Learn (K-Means, KNN, ANN, PCA)

API developement

Front end design with React, HTML, CSS

Implementing research papers
